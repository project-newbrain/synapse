    <h2> Project Newbrain </h2>
    <p>Updated: September 23, 2019

Use neuroscience to form habits that last. This is a research project to solve the epidemic of "in-action" in search for happiness and meaning. Let's develop it together.

And Yes, we give you money for creating good habits. See below for details.

***

What you get and neurological methods that increase your chance of forming new habits

Feedback from neuroscientists and behavioural experts.

[Ican] - Write down your habit plan in a post.

[Idid] - Post an image of your habit in action. We give away money (5$ worth of Amazon coupons) to whoever posts the most [Idid] in a given week.

Share and Invite - Invite a friend to participate in this subreddit. If they post anything subject-related and mention you as the referral, we'll count your invites in selecting the weekly winner of 5$.

[Reward] - Every Monday, we'll announce the winner of 5$, where we give money to anyone who posted the most [Idid] in a given week. Check details below

Neuroscience behind these methods

[Ican] - This minimizes the chance of procrastination by disengaging from the cluster of brain regions referred to as the "rehearsal loop".

[Idid] - This strengthens the above effect of writing down.

Share and Invite - Human brain places more value on acting in a social setting than it does on acting when you're alone.

[Reward] - Once you recognize an action related reward, your dopamine level skyrockets. If your brain expects a reward after an action, you're more likely to pursue that action and stick to it.

Reward rules

Every week, we'll select a winner and give money for posting the most [Idid].

The start and the end of counting [Idid] and invites will be posted every Monday.

If two or more people posted the same numbers of [Idid], we'll count the invites you've made to this community (they must have done at least one subject related post).

We'll check the invitee's posts for your referral info (Reddit ID).

Important

Terminology
